<h1>About me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I was born and raised in Kazakhstan, a place that taught me resilience, respect, and the value of hard work from an early age. Growing up in a disciplined environment and being deeply involved in sports shaped my mindset — I learned to stay focused under pressure, set long-term goals, and push through difficulties. MMA became a major part of my life, teaching me mental strength, self-control, and responsibility, lessons that extend far beyond the sport.

Alongside athletics, I developed a strong interest in technology and creativity. I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, where I learned structured thinking, problem-solving, and how to turn ideas into functional systems. Over time, I began applying these skills in real-world environments such as live e-commerce, digital marketing, and content production.

My journey later expanded beyond Kazakhstan to include work and life experience in the USA, Russia, and Canada. Living in different countries exposed me to diverse cultures, work ethics, and perspectives, helping me become more adaptable and open-minded. I learned how to communicate with people from different backgrounds, perform in fast-paced environments, and take initiative without constant guidance.

Today, I continue to combine discipline from sports, logic from technology, and creativity from media and marketing. I believe in constant self-improvement, honest work, and building a life through consistent effort rather than shortcuts. Every experience I’ve had — from competition and study to work abroad — has shaped my character and clarified my direction.</p>
